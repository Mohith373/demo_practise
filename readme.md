hi and hello
after you executed all the process you can update the code any number of times by using commits and commands by any terminal

git remote -v tells the branch where you are in presently
git remote rm origin removes already existing remote control then we can add new remote control through github link

mostly use only main branch by creating your own
next see what is git pull and also merge branch of some branch

we can create different branches as you want but mainly focus on main branch only
